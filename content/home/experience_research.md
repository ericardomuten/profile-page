    description: Supervisor&#58 [Iman Rahmansyah Tayibnapis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iman-rahmansyah-tayibnapis-25032b176/)<br>Designed a real-time face tracking and blemish removal system to create a webcam filter application. A numerical threshold in HSV color space and elliptical kernel dilations was applied to the image to detect the skin. Blemishes were detected by utilizing CLAHE and blob detection. Trained a YOLO model to track the face using PyTorch. Coded algorithms for blemish removal using OpenCV. Achieved 85-90% of blemishes removal.

    description: Supervisor&#58 [Prof. Gentiane Venture](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RAOhaYYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)<br>Did [research](https://ericardomuten.com/project/learning-human-touch-interaction-with-convolutional-neural-networks/) in using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify types of touch interaction (poke, scratch, etc.) from humans by learning the data pattern from a force sensor (ShokacChip TS). Trained the model using Keras and TensorFlow. The model reached 88% real-time accuracy. Coded a robotic arm's servos using inverse kinematics in MATLAB to make it moves according to the type of touch being predicted by the network as a response.
